CouchBase:


Couchbase Server is a NoSQL document database for interactive web applications. It has a flexible data model, is easily scalable, provides consistent high performance and is capable of serving application data with 100% uptime.

Couchbase is the merge of two popular NOSQL technologies:
Couchbase is a merge between CouchDB and Membase to create an easily scalable and high performance database

    -   Membase, which provides persistence, replication, sharding to the high performance memcached technology

    -   CouchDB, which pioneers the document oriented model based on JSON


NOSQL Data store.
Here NOSQL means NOT ONLY SQL

What is NoSQL ?
 - NoSQL - Not only SQL
 - Non Relational database 

 Advantages of NoSql Ovwer RDBMS

  - Handles Big Data
  - Data Models - No predefined schema
  - Data Structure - NoSql Handles unstructured database
  - Cheaper to manage
  - Scaling - Scale out / Horizental scaling 




Types of NoSql Databases

 - Document Databases [ MongoDB, CouchDB] - Dynamic Doc object
 - Column Databases [ Apache Casandara] - Analytics
 - Key-Value stores [ Redis, Couchbase Server] - For Huge Data
 - Cache Systems [ Redis, MemCache]
 - Graph Databases [ Neo4J] - social network


 Couchbase server cluster which can be connected ACTIVE-ACTIVE or ACTIVE-PASSIVE topolgy providing Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR).
 Disaster Recovery
 Geographically availability

 Bucket Types: 

 -  Couchbase buckets: These store data persistently, as well as in memory. They allow data to be automatically replicated for high availability, using the Database Change Protocol (DCP); and dynamically scaled across multiple clusters, by means of Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR).
 -  Empheral buckets : Only in RAM. For better serving of I/ONLY
 -  Memcached buckets: For caching


 Core Database Engine 
    - Multi-Dimensional Scalability
    - Memory First Architecture


Couchbase High Level Architecture.

Coushbase nodes are identical
 it has Cluster Manager (Node / Cluster Coordination, REST API, Web UI), Cache and Storage.

 Six independently scalable services
  - Data  :
  - Query  :
  - Index  :
  - Search  :
  - Eventing  : 
  - Analytics :
 


Key   - 25 bytes (Max Size)
Value - 20MB (Max Size)

Glossary/Terminology:

Node - Couchbase Server Instance
Cluster - Networked set of nodes, sharing distributed buckets.
Bucket  - Logical set (Keyspace) of uniquely keyed documents, evenly spread across cluster.


Scalably and multi Dimensional clusters

multi-model NoSQL document-oriented database 

 Couchbase Server is designed to provide easy-to-scale key-value or JSON document access with low latency and high sustained throughput

Inbuild Caching Mechanism

Disk Queue
REplication Queue 
Manager Cache 

Each Bucket has 1024 Virtual Bucket sets


In case of cluster when you are adding new node. In the SERVER option, we need to REBALANCE the node to distribute the load and data.
SERVER --> REBALANC 

Whenever you remove the node, ensure you dont remove the node that you are logged into.
