CouchBase:


Couchbase Server is a NoSQL document database for interactive web applications. It has a flexible data model, is easily scalable, provides consistent high performance and is capable of serving application data with 100% uptime.

Couchbase is the merge of two popular NOSQL technologies:
Couchbase is a merge between CouchDB and Membase to create an easily scalable and high performance database

    -   Membase, which provides persistence, replication, sharding to the high performance memcached technology

    -   CouchDB, which pioneers the document oriented model based on JSON


NOSQL Data store.
Here NOSQL means NOT ONLY SQL

What is NoSQL ?
 - NoSQL - Not only SQL
 - Non Relational database 

 Advantages of NoSql Ovwer RDBMS

  - Handles Big Data
  - Data Models - No predefined schema
  - Data Structure - NoSql Handles unstructured database
  - Cheaper to manage
  - Scaling - Scale out / Horizental scaling 




Types of NoSql Databases

 - Document Databases [ MongoDB, CouchDB] - Dynamic Doc object
 - Column Databases [ Apache Casandara] - Analytics
 - Key-Value stores [ Redis, Couchbase Server] - For Huge Data
 - Cache Systems [ Redis, MemCache]
 - Graph Databases [ Neo4J] - social network


 Couchbase server cluster which can be connected ACTIVE-ACTIVE or ACTIVE-PASSIVE topolgy providing Cross Data Center Replication (XDCR).
 Disaster Recovery
 Geographically availability

 Bucket Types: 

 -  Couchbase buckets: These store data persistently, as well as in memory. They allow data to be automatically replicated for high availability, using the Database Change Protocol (DCP); and dynamically scaled across multiple clusters, by means of Cross Datacenter Replication (XDCR).
 -  Empheral buckets : Only in RAM. For better serving of I/ONLY
 -  Memcached buckets: For caching


 Core Database Engine 
    - Multi-Dimensional Scalability
    - Memory First Architecture


Couchbase High Level Architecture.

Coushbase nodes are identical
 it has Cluster Manager (Node / Cluster Coordination, REST API, Web UI), Cache and Storage.

 Six independently scalable services
  - Data  :
  - Query  :
  - Index  :
  - Search  :
  - Eventing  : 
  - Analytics :
 


Key   - 25 bytes (Max Size)
Value - 20MB (Max Size)

Glossary/Terminology:

Node - Couchbase Server Instance
Cluster - Networked set of nodes, sharing distributed buckets.
Bucket  - Logical set (Keyspace) of uniquely keyed documents, evenly spread across cluster.


Scalably and multi Dimensional clusters
